# First Flutter app(s)!
This is a repository that hosts all projects made for the following Udemy course:

Flutter & Dart - The Complete Flutter App Development Course (Udemy): https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-dart-the-complete-flutter-app-development-course/

## Projects in this directory

## Small warning
Following the course meant working on a single Android Studio project for all apps developed. I'll separate each individual app into separate projects in the future!
